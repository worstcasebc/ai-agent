# AI-Agent for Bid Processes

## Status

The project is at it's first stage and more a collection of code-snippets, than a regular project. It is intended as a prototypical implementation to build knowledge in the field of AI while simultaneously generating meaningful value.

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered agent designed to streamline and enhance the bid processes around an OPLs client. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and automation, the AI-agent extracts information from documents, processes it intelligently, and performs various tasks to support the bid-workflow.

## Features

- &#9989; **OPTIONAL: Mail Retrieval**: Automatically check mail-account for new bid-related mails, add mail-body to LLM-context and search for bid-id.
- &#10060; **OPTIONAL: Download Documents**: Use bid-id to download ZIP-package from DTVP.
- &#9989; **Document Extraction**: Automatically extracts content from bid-related documents (ZIP).
- &#9989; **Chunking and Embedding**: Splits documents into manageable chunks and generates embeddings for efficient information retrieval.
- &#9989; **LLM Integration**: Feeds processed data into a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant information and insights.
- &#10060; **Task Automation**:
    - &#9989; Prepares ESR-slides based on extracted data
    - Schedules and invites stakeholders to ESR- and SSR-meetings
    - Creates and updates CRM entry automatically -> fake API
    - Creates Talento-opportunity to search for partners to staff the project-team -> fake API
    - Start DRSR-request automatically -> fake API
    - Find and retrieve project-references from BidGen and/or BDKX
    - Create concepts and other requested documents

## Benefits

- Saves time by automating repetitive tasks
- Improves accuracy in bid preparation and management
- Enhances collaboration and decision-making with timely insights
- Reduces manual effort, allowing you to focus on strategic activities

## Choose your model

- If OpenAI should be used, an API-key is necessary. Get yours [here](https://platform.openai.com/).
- Track costs of OpenAI-requests within the [Usage-dashboad](https://platform.openai.com/usage).
- Add your API-key into '.env' and ensure, that the '.env'-file is mentioned within '.gitignore'. Don't share the key.

- If local LLM-model is what you are here for, then download one of the models mentioned in belows step 7 and put it into ./models. 

- Update '.env' accordingly and choose the right method in query_data.py as well as in get_embedding_function.py.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository into your workspace-folder:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/worstcasebc/ai-agent.git
     ```

2. change directory
     ```bash
     cd ai-agent
     ```

3. Create environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```

4. Activate environment
     
     If powershell is used
     ```bash
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
     ```
     In case of terminal-window
     ```bash
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

5. Installation of dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. set-up for your environment

     copy '.env.example' into '.env' and update with your paths

7. Define the language-model

     * Place your model within ./models and update the .env-variable (Download-link below)
     
     * Tested with

          * OpenAI (when switching models, resetting the database by populating it new with parameter --reset is necessary)

          * [Orca-2-13B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Orca-2-13B-GGUF/blob/main/orca-2-13b.Q4_0.gguf)

          * [Meta-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/blob/main/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_0.gguf)

8. Run the application-parts:
     
     - to check email, you need a mail-account with one DTVP-email inculuding a Bundesbank-bid
     ```bash
     python check_mail.py
     ```

     - you need one ZIP-file downloaded from DTVP for bids
     ```bash
     python extract_zip.py
     ```
     ```bash
     python populate_database.py --reset
     ```
     ```bash
     python query_data.py "What is the name of the project?"
     ```
      ```bash
     python query_data.py "Bitte suche mir aus allen URLs, in der im Kontext bereitgestellten Mail von DTVP, diejenige URL heraus, die zur Projektanfrage der Deutschen Bundesbank, Zentralbereich Beschaffungen geh√∂rt und exztrahiere mir die in dieser URL genannte ID, welche mit 'CX beginnt."
     ```
     ```bash
     python pupdate_ESR_slides.py
     ```
